Things that need to be fixed in Simson $Rev$
==========================================================

20070205  Luca     Extend the manual with
                   - maybe extend the section about boundary conditions

20060919  Philipp  Add saving of yz-planes in bla

20060929  Mattias  y-integration of statistics (in pxyst)

20070205  Antonios Do a clean compensator version and try
                   to merge it with the main code

20070205**Lars-Uve Fix parallelisation of the wall roughness

20070205* Lars-Uve Parallelisation of ffun

20070207**Mattias  When theta=0 the value of w for z=-zl/2 should be zero
                   otherwise the spanwise symmetry is broken???
                   (this error is on the level of that the gaussian envelope
                   of the localized disturbance doesn't go to zero at the
                   boxedge)

20080507  Mattias  Make definition of all constants consistent in cvecfft
		   (grep 71)

==========================================================
Resolved issues
==========================================================
20060928  Mattias  Completed the configuration feature for
                   installation and compilation (r190)

20061003  Mattias  Added mean-flow subtraction in rit (r222)

20061009  Mattias  Removed double precision converter fsdf
                   and its appearance in all Makefile.config
                   and the manual (r263)

20061128  Philipp  Resolved in r352-357:
                   Figure out/clean the different bls versions
                   - bls (version 1.8) using fskch.f ==> RENAMED bls-old
                   - bls-heat (based on version 1.9) using fsc.f
                   - fskanc/bls1.5 (version 1.5) using fskanc.f ==> REMOVED
                   and add option to read similarity solution table
                   written by fskanc.f/fsc.f in bla. ==> DONE
                   Shall we keep the Chebyshev tau version fskch? ==> REMOVED

20061128  Philipp  Implemented statistics of scalar in boxxyst

20061207  Mattias  Corrected parallel flow forcing for FSC
                   flows (r400-401,r406-412)

20070205  Philipp  Finished/tested the combined channel/boundary
                   layer version

20070207  Mattias  Included necessary features from sta and
                   sta-heat into bls and removed sta and
                   sta-heat (r471-473)

20070207  Philipp  Combined fou with fouLX

20070528  Shervin  Included jet-in-crossflow in main version at r587.

200706??  Philipp  Added constant mass-flux for channel flow in r???.

20071110  Philipp  Extend the manual with
                   - LES (done)
                   - scalar (done, could however be extended)
                   - SFD (done)
                   - linearised/perturbation version (done)
		   - MHD (done)
		   - Parallelisation 6.3 (done)

20071120  Mattias  Checked all flow types for 
          Philipp  consistency (incl. channel/bl etc.)

20071120  Mattias  Test problems added for each nice test case,
          Philipp  running with the latest bla.i/par.f.

20071120  Mattias  Checked two-dimensional simulations
          Philipp
